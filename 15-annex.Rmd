This Chapter contains technical details on the algorithms available in `sits`. It is intended to support those that want to understand how the package works and also want to contribute to its development.

## Including new methods for machine learning{-}

This section provides guidance for experts that want to include new methods for machine learning that work in connection with `sits`. The discussion below assumes familiarity with the R language. Developers should consult Hadley Wickham's excellent book [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/), especially Chapter 10 on "Function Factories". 

All machine learning and deep learning algorithm in `sits` follow the same logic; all models are created by `sits_train()`. This function has two parameters: (a) `samples`, a set of time series with the training samples; (b) `ml_method`, a function that fits the model to the input data. The result is a function that is passed on to `sits_classify()` to classify time series or data cubes. The structure of `sits_train()` is simple, as shown below.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = FALSE}
sits_train <- function(samples, ml_method){
    # train a ml classifier with the given data
    result <- ml_method(samples)
    # return a valid machine learning method
    return(result)
}
```

In R terms, `sits_train()` is a function factory, or a function that makes functions. Such behavior is possible because functions are first-class objects in R. In other words, they can be bound to a name in the same way that variables are. A second propriety of R is that functions capture (enclose) the environment in which they are created. In other words, when a function is returned as a result of another function, the internal variables used to create it are available inside its environment. In programming language, this technique is called "closure". 

The following definition from Wikipedia captures the purpose of clousures: *"Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. A closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope."*

In `sits`, the properties of closures are used as a basis for making training and classification independent. The return of `sits_train()` is a model that contains information on how to classify input values, as well as information on the samples used to train the model. 

To ensure all models work in the same fashion, machine learning functions in `sits` also share the same data structure for prediction. This data structure is created by `sits_predictors()`, which transforms the time series tibble into a set of values suitable for using as training data, as shown in the following example.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = TRUE}
data("samples_matogrosso_mod13q1", package = "sitsdata")
pred <- sits_predictors(samples_matogrosso_mod13q1)
pred
```

The predictors tibble is organized as a combination of the "X" and "Y" values used by machine learning algorithms. The first two columns are `sample_id` and `label`. The other columns contain the data values, organized by band and time. For machine learning methods that are not time-sensitive, such as random forest, this organization is sufficient for training. In the case of time-sensitive methods such as `tempCNN`, further arrangements are necessary to ensure the tensors have the right dimensions. Please refer to the `sits_tempcnn()` source code for an example of how to adapt the prediction table to appropriate `torch` tensor.

Most algorithms require data normalization. Therefore, the `sits_predictors()` code is usually combined with methods that extract statistical information and then normalize the data, as in the example below.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = FALSE}
 # Data normalization
ml_stats <- sits_stats(samples)
# extract the training samples
train_samples  <- sits_predictors(samples)
# normalize the training samples
train_samples  <- sits_pred_normalize(pred = train_samples, stats = ml_stats)
```        

The following example shows the implementation of the LightGBM algorithm, designed to efficiently handle large-scale datasets and perform fast training and inference [@Ke2017]. Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a stronger model. LightGBM specifically focuses on optimizing the training and prediction speed, making it particularly suitable for large datasets. The example builds a model using the `lightgbm` package.  This model will then be applied later to obtain a classification.

Since LightGBM is a gradient boosting model, it uses part of the data as testing data to improve the model's performance. The split between the training and test samples is controlled by a parameter, as shown in the following code extract.

```{r, tidy="styler", eval = FALSE}
# split the data into training and validation data sets
# create partitions different splits of the input data
test_samples <- sits_pred_sample(train_samples,
                                 frac = validation_split
)
# Remove the lines used for validation
sel <- !(train_samples$sample_id %in% test_samples$sample_id)
train_samples <- train_samples[sel, ]
```

<!--
PEDRO: O trecho abaixo esta confuso porque ele fala de "`lightgbm` algorithm", mas o que existe e'
lightgbm::lgb.train() e lgb_method(). Acho que seria melhor usar "LightGBM algorithm" ou os
nomes das funcoes especificas. Os parametros boosting_type, objective, etc. sao da funcao lgb.train(), sendo tambem definidos na funcao lgb_method() implementada abaixo.
-->
The parameters for the `lightgbm` algorithm, as defined in its documentation, are: (a) `boosting_type`, boosting algorithm; (b) `objective`, classification objective (c) `num_iterations`, number of runs; (d) `max_depth`, maximum tree depth; (d) `min_samples_leaf`,  minimum size of data in one leaf (to avoid overfitting); (f) `learning_rate`,  learning rate of the algorithm; (g) `n_iter_no_change`, number of successive iterations to stop training when validation metrics do not improve; (h) `validation_split`, fraction of training data to be used as validation data. 

The training part of the `lightgbm` algorithm uses two functions: (a) `lgb.Dataset()`, which transforms training and test samples into internal structures; (b) `lgb.train()`, which trains the model.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = TRUE}

        train_samples <- sits_pred_normalize(pred = train_samples, stats = ml_stats)
        
        # find number of labels
        labels <- sits_labels(samples)
        n_labels <- length(labels)
        # lightGBM uses numerical labels starting from 0
        int_labels <- c(1:n_labels) - 1

        )

        )
        # call method and return the trained model
        lgbm_model <- lightgbm::lgb.train(

            valids  = list(test_data = lgbm_test_samples),
            params  = lgb_params,
            verbose = -1,
            ...
        )
        # serialize the model for parallel processing
        lgbm_model_string <- lgbm_model$save_model_to_string(NULL)
        # construct model predict closure function and returns
        predict_fun <- function(values) {
            # reload the model (unserialize)
            lgbm_model <- lightgbm::lgb.load(model_str = lgbm_model_string)
            # Performs data normalization - returns only values
            # in the prediction only values are available
            values <- sits_pred_normalize(pred = values, stats = ml_stats)
            # predict probabilities
            prediction <- stats::predict(lgbm_model,
                               data = as.matrix(values),
                               rawscore = FALSE,
                               reshape = TRUE
            )
            # adjust the names of the columns of the probs
            colnames(prediction) <- labels
            # retrieve the prediction results
            return(prediction)
        }
        # Set model class
        class(predict_fun) <- c("sits_model", class(predict_fun))
        return(predict_fun)
    }
    result <- sits_factory_function(samples, result_fun)
    return(result)
}
```

The above code has two nested functions: `results_fun()` and `predict_fun()`. When `lgb_method()` is called, it transforms the input samples into predictors and normalizes them. Then, it uses these predictors to train the algorithm, creating a model (`result_mlr`). This model is included as part of the function's closure and becomes available at classification time. Then the code creates `prediction_fun()`, which applies the `result_mlr` model to the input values to be classified. This is the function returned by `results_fun()` which contains all the necessary information for classification. At classification time, the model is called directly.

The last lines of the code also include the convenience function `sits_factory_function()`, shown below. This function allows the model to be called either as part of `sits_train()` or to be called independently, with the same result.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = FALSE}
sits_factory_function <- function(samples, fun) {
    # if no data is given, we prepare a
    # function to be called as a parameter of other functions
    if (purrr::is_null(data)) {
        result <- fun
    } else {
        # ...otherwise compute the result on the input data
        result <- fun(data)
    }
    return(result)
}
```

There is one additional requirement for the algorithm to be compatible with `sits`. Data cube processing algorithms in `sits` run in parallel. For this reason, once the classification model is trained, it is serialized, as shown in the following line. The serialized version of the model is exported to the function closure, so it can be used at classification time.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = FALSE}
# serialize the model for parallel processing
lgbm_model_string <- lgbm_model$save_model_to_string(NULL)
```

During classification,  `predict_fun()` is called in parallel by each CPU. At this moment, the serialized string is transformed back into a model, which is then run to obtain the classification, as shown in the code.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = FALSE}
# unserialize the model
lgbm_model <- lightgbm::lgb.load(model_str = lgbm_model_string)
```


Therefore, using function factories that produce closures, `sits` keeps the classification function independent of the machine learning or deep learning algorithm. This policy allows independent proposal, testing, and development of new classification methods. It also enables improvements on parallel processing methods without affecting the existing classification methods.

To illustrate this separation between training and classification, the new algorithm developed in the chapter using `lightgbm` will be used to classify a data cube. The code is the same as the one in Chapter [Introduction](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/introduction.html) as an example of data cube classification, except for the use of `lgb_method()`. 

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = TRUE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Classification map for Sinop using LightGBM.", fig.align="center"}
data("samples_matogrosso_mod13q1", package = "sitsdata")
# Create a data cube using local files
sinop <- sits_cube(
  source = "BDC", 
  collection  = "MOD13Q1-6",
  data_dir = system.file("extdata/sinop", package = "sitsdata"),  
  parse_info = c("X1", "X2", "tile", "band", "date")
)
# The data cube has only "NDVI" and "EVI" bands 
# Select the bands NDVI and EVI
samples_2bands <- sits_select(
    data = samples_matogrosso_mod13q1, 
    bands = c("NDVI", "EVI")
)
# train lightGBM model
lgb_model <- sits_train(samples_2bands, lgb_method())

# Classify the data cube
sinop_probs <- sits_classify(
    data = sinop, 
    ml_model = lgb_model,
    multicores = 1,
    memsize = 8,
    output_dir = "./tempdir/chp15"
)
# Perform spatial smoothing
sinop_bayes <- sits_smooth(
    cube = sinop_probs,
    multicores = 2,
    memsize = 8,
    output_dir = "./tempdir/chp15"
)
# Label the smoothed file 
sinop_map <- sits_label_classification(
    cube = sinop_bayes, 
    output_dir = "./tempdir/chp3"
)
# plot the result
plot(sinop_map, title = "Sinop Classification Map")
```

The above example shows how it is possible to extend `sits` with new machine learning algorithms.

## How colors work in sits{-}

In examples provided in the book, the color legend is taken from a predefined color table provided by `sits`. This default color table is displayed using `sits_colors_show()`. This color definition file assigns colors to 99 class names, including the IPCC and IGBP land classes. 

```{r, tidy = "styler", out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Default colors used in the sits package (Source: Authors)."}
# Display default `sits` colors
sits_colors_show()
```

The color table can be extended or adjusted by accessing and modifying the default color table, which is retrieved using `sits_colors()`.

```{r}
# Retrieve the color table
color_tb <- sits_colors()
# Show the color table
color_tb
```

The default color table can be redefined using `sits_colors_set()`. As an example of a user-defined color table, consider a definition that covers level 1 of the Anderson Classification System used in the US National Land Cover Data, obtained by defining a new color table, as shown below. The colors can be defined by HEX values or by names accepted as R color codes.
```{r, tidy = "styler", out.width = "80%", out.height = "80%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Example of Anderson Land Classification Scheme use in sits (Source: Authors)."}
# Define a color table based on the Anderson Land Classification System
us_nlcd <- tibble::tibble(name = character(), color = character())
us_nlcd <- us_nlcd %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Urban Built Up", color =  "#85929E") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Agricultural Land", color = "#F0B27A") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Rangeland", color = "#F1C40F") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Forest Land", color = "#27AE60") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Water", color = "#2980B9") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Wetland", color = "#D4E6F1") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Barren Land", color = "#FDEBD0") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Tundra", color = "#EBDEF0") %>% 
  tibble::add_row(name = "Snow and Ice", color = "#F7F9F9")
# Load the color table into `sits`
sits_colors_set(us_nlcd)
# Show the new color table used by sits
sits_colors_show()
```

The original default `sits` color table can be restored using `sits_colors_reset()`. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
# Reset the color table
sits_colors_reset()
```

As an alternative, a legend can be used directly as a parameter to `plot()`. Please see the example provided in Section "Map Reclassification" in Chapter [Image classification in data cubes](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/image-classification-in-data-cubes.html). 

## Exporting data to JSON{-}

Both the data cube and the time series tibble can be exported to exchange formats such as JSON.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
# Export the data cube to JSON
jsonlite::write_json(
  x = s2_20LKP_cube_MPC,
  path = "./data_cube.json",
  pretty = TRUE)

# Export the time series to JSON
jsonlite::write_json(
  x = samples_prodes_4classes,
  path = "./time_series.json",
  pretty = TRUE)
```
